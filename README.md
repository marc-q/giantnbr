!!Under construction!!

## How it started:

GiantNbr started as an weekend project as most of my projects do. I read about computing pi digits with computers and wanted to do this myself.
So i began working on an library that would allow me to compute big numbers. Its not capable of doing it though but i will work on it in my spare times to reach the goal of creating a program that can compute pi.
